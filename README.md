## Getting Started

### Quick Start (Recommended)

Run one of these commands to install dependencies (if needed) and start the development server:

```bash
# Option 1: Using the shell script (checks if dependencies are installed first)
./start.sh

# Option 2: Using npm script (always installs dependencies)
npm start
```

### Manual Start

If you prefer to run commands separately:

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run dev`

The development server will be available at `http://localhost:5173`
